## Best Practices

### Meaningful Variable Names

- Use UPPERCASE for extracted or random variables
- Use UNIQUE names for all variables
- Choose descriptive names that indicate the data's purpose
- Example: `USER_EMAIL`, `ORDER_TOTAL`, `PRODUCT_ID`

### Extraction Timing

- Extract data as soon as it becomes available
- Verify the extracted data before using it
- Consider adding waits before extraction if data is dynamic

### Error Handling

Add verification after extraction.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions when working with extractions:

### Data Not Found

- Ensure the element is visible before extraction
- Check if dynamic content has loaded
- Verify selector accuracy

### Invalid Data Format

- Add verification steps after extraction
- Use JavaScript for data cleaning if needed
- Adding wait steps for dynamic content

### Variable Scope

- Variables are available throughout the test
- Use unique names to avoid conflicts
- Consider prefixing variables for clarity
