title: 'Common Pitfalls When Writing Tests in Testavi'
description: 'Avoid these common authoring mistakes to ensure your tests run reliably and clearly communicate intent'
---

## 1. Incorrect or Misformatted Starting URL

**What happens:**
Tests fail immediately or start on the wrong page.

**Why it matters:**
The Start URL is where Testavi begins your test flow—it must be complete and properly formatted.

**Correct example:**
Always include `https://` and the complete URL.

**Incorrect examples:**
- Missing protocol (`https://`)
- Incomplete URLs

<Tip>
Always copy and paste the URL directly from the browser's address bar.
</Tip>

## 2. Mixing Actions Inside "Verify" Steps

**What happens:**
Tests become semantically unclear or are misinterpreted.

**Bad example:**
Combining verification and action in one step.

**Good example:**
Separate verification and action into distinct steps.

<Info>
**Rule of thumb:**
- **Actions** = things the test does (e.g., click, scroll)
- **Verifications** = things the test checks (e.g., visible, present)

Keep them in separate steps.
</Info>

## 3. Non-Scenario Table Tests in Scenario Table Test Suite

**What happens:**
Static tests placed inside a scenario table suite will execute once per scenario row, potentially causing duplicate confirmations or side effects.

**Bad example:**
Static verifications running in a scenario table suite.

**Good practice:**
Keep tests that do not rely on scenario table variables in a separate test or suite. This prevents static verifications from running multiple times.

## 4. Using "Go to URL" Inside Test Steps

**What happens:**
Testavi can't interpret "Go to URL" commands mid-test, causing scripts to fail.

**Bad example:**
Using "Go to URL" as a test step.

**Good example:**
- Set the Start URL in your test's settings
- Use actions for in-test navigation (e.g., click on navigation links)

## 5. Tab/Browser Navigations

**What happens:**
Tests may break or misinterpret intent if you attempt to change tabs or navigate the browser without using supported actions.

**What to do:**
Use browser action steps for any tab or navigation changes.

<Warning>
Always use the documented browser actions component for tab switches, window focus, and URL navigations.
</Warning>

## 6. Scrolling

**What happens:**
The agent only interacts with elements in view unless instructed otherwise. Tests may fail to locate off-screen elements.

**What to do:**
Explicitly include scroll steps before verifications or actions.

The agent will also scroll to find out-of-viewport items, but specifying scrolls improves test stability. See [Discrete Actions: Scroll](/discrete-actions#scroll).

<Info>
Remember that the agent sees only what a human sees. Include scroll instructions to ensure consistent element visibility.
</Info>

## 7. Accessing Restricted Domains via Preview Editor

**What happens:**
Direct navigation to restricted domains (e.g., Testavimail.com) may be blocked due to IP restrictions.

**What to do:**
Access these domains through the Preview Editor, which proxies requests and bypasses IP blocks. When you run the test normally, the agent routes via Preview Editor and executes steps successfully.

<Tip>
Use the Preview Editor view to interact with Testavimail.com. Direct browser access may show a blocked IP error, but tests will pass when executed through Testavi Preview.

## ✅ Authoring Do's & Don'ts

| ❌ Don't | ✅ Do |
|----------|-------|
| Use incomplete or incorrect URLs | Use full URLs including `https://`, copy directly |
| Mix actions and verifications | Keep actions and checks in separate steps |
| Use "Go to URL" mid-test | Set the start URL in test settings |
| Combine static steps inside scenario loops | Keep tables fully dynamic; extract shared setup |
| Attempt tab or browser navigations without browser actions | Use browser action steps for tab/window navigation |
| Omit scroll instructions | Explicitly include scroll steps before actions/verifications |
| Rely on direct navigation to restricted domains (e.g., Testavimail.com) | Access via Preview Editor to bypass IP restrictions |
