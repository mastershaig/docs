<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Incorrect or Misformatted Starting URL">
    **What happens:** 

    Tests fail immediately or start on the wrong page.

    **Why it matters:** 

    The Start URL is where Testavi begins your test flow—it must be complete and properly formatted.

    **Correct example:** 

    Always include `https://` and the complete URL. 

    ![Screenshot2026 01 15at01 44 57](/images/Screenshot2026-01-15at01.44.57.png)

    **Incorrect examples:**

    - Missing protocol (`https://`) 

      ![Screenshot2026 01 15at01 45 31](/images/Screenshot2026-01-15at01.45.31.png)
    - Incomplete URLs 

      ![Screenshot2026 01 15at01 45 43](/images/Screenshot2026-01-15at01.45.43.png)

    <Tip>
      Always copy and paste the URL directly from the browser's address bar.

  <Accordion title="2. Mixing Actions Inside 'Verify' Steps">
    **What happens:**

    Tests become semantically unclear or are misinterpreted.

    **Bad example:**

    ![Screenshot2025 07 05at11 01 54AM](/images/Screenshot2025-07-05at11.01.54AM.png)

    **Good example:**

    ![Screenshot2025 07 05at10 53 16AM](/images/Screenshot2025-07-05at10.53.16AM.png)

    Separate verification and action into distinct steps.

    **Rule of thumb:**

    - **Actions** = things the test does (e.g., click, scroll)
    - **Verifications** = things the test checks (e.g., visible, present)

    Keep them in separate steps.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="3. Using Go to URL Inside Test Steps">
    **What happens:** Testavi can't interpret "Go to URL" commands mid-test, causing scripts to fail.

    **Bad example:**

    ![Screenshot2025 07 05at11 54 00AM](/images/Screenshot2025-07-05at11.54.00AM.png)

    **Good example:**

    - Set the Start URL in your test's settings

      ![Screenshot2025 07 05at11 54 57AM 1](/images/Screenshot2025-07-05at11.54.57AM-1.png)
    - Use actions for in-test navigation (e.g., click on navigation links)

      ![Screenshot2025 07 05at11 58 12AM](/images/Screenshot2025-07-05at11.58.12AM.png)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="4. Scrolling">
    **What happens:**

    The agent only interacts with elements in view unless instructed otherwise. Tests may fail to locate off-screen elements.

    **What to do:**

    Explicitly include scroll steps before verifications or actions.

    ![Screenshot2025 07 05at12 09 50PM](/images/Screenshot2025-07-05at12.09.50PM.png)

    The agent will also scroll to find out-of-viewport items, but specifying scrolls improves test stability. See Discrete Actions: Scroll.

    <Info>
      Remember that the agent sees only what a human sees. Include scroll instructions to ensure consistent element visibility.

## ✅ Authoring Do's & Don'ts

| ❌ Don't                                                                 | ✅ Do                                                         |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Use incomplete or incorrect URLs                                        | Use full URLs including `https://`, copy directly            |
| Mix actions and verifications                                           | Keep actions and checks in separate steps                    |
| Use "Go to URL" mid-test                                                | Set the start URL in test settings                           |
| Combine static steps inside scenario loops                              | Keep tables fully dynamic; extract shared setup              |
| Attempt tab or browser navigations without browser actions              | Use browser action steps for tab/window navigation           |
| Omit scroll instructions                                                | Explicitly include scroll steps before actions/verifications |
| Rely on direct navigation to restricted domains (e.g., Testavimail.com) | Access via Preview Editor to bypass IP restrictions          |
