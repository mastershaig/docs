## Core Principles

### 1. Descriptive Elements

**Level 1: Basic Text**

**Level 2: Position Context**

**Level 3: Surrounding Elements**

### 2. Verify States

Always begin with 'Verify' to check for:
- Element presence
- Content Validation

## Writing Steps

Each test step is one of the 4 types: **ACTION**, **VERIFICATION**, **JAVASCRIPT**, **EXTRACT**

### Action
Click, Type, Hover, Scroll, Wait, Upload, or Select operations for user interactions

### Verify
Check elements, states, and conditions on the page

### JavaScript
Run custom JavaScript code for complex operations

### Extract
Pull and store data from the page for later use

## Best Practices

- **Start Simple**: Begin with discrete actions for common interactions
- **Validate Early**: Use verification actions to catch issues quickly
- **Extract Strategically**: Only extract data you need for subsequent steps
- **JavaScript as Backup**: Use JavaScript actions when other options aren't sufficient

## Common Pitfalls

- **Multiple Actions**: Combining multiple actions in one step
- **Vague Descriptions**: Using unclear element descriptions
- **Missing Brackets**: Forgetting to enclose values or elements
- **Skipping Verifications**: Not validating important states
- **Implicit Waits**: Not specifying wait durations
